# StarbucksAIDriveThruAssistant

Project Overview:

This innovative project aims to develop an AI solution that streamlines the drive-thru ordering process, leading to:
•	Increased Efficiency: The AI assistant would handle routine order-taking, freeing up baristas for more complex tasks and improving wait times.
•	Personalized Recommendations: Using customer data and AI algorithms, the assistant could offer personalized suggestions, increasing order value and customer satisfaction.
•	Reduced Errors: AI-powered order processing can minimize mistakes, improving order accuracy and customer experience.
Let's take a brief look at how the software functions. Kindly review the YouTube link for a sample demonstration.
This short video (link to the video: https://youtu.be/gI-uWWNGfGA) demonstrates how a customer interacts with the AI assistant by placing an order for 2 drinks. The AI efficiently records and confirms the order, streamlining the process.
This video (link: https://youtu.be/TIw-5DjtUOM) showcases the AI assistant's ability to upsell products. While recording the order for 2 drinks, the AI also suggests complementary items, potentially leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.
